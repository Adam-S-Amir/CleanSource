## Copilot

Step 1: Android IDE setup
Step 2: Plan Your App- Define Features: List out all the features you want in your app, such as:
    - Fetching news articles from multiple sources
    - Comparing similar headlines
    - Providing summaries
    - User interface for selecting sources and viewing summaries
    - Design UI/UX: Tools like Figma or Adobe XD can be helpful.
Step 3: Fetch News Articles- Choose News APIs: Use APIs like NewsAPI, Google News API, or GDELT to fetch news articles.
    - Set Up API Calls: Use Retrofit or OkHttp libraries to make network requests to these APIs.
Step 4: Compare Headlines- Text Similarity Algorithm: Implement a text similarity algorithm to compare headlines. You can use libraries like Apache OpenNLP or Google's ML Kit for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
    - Group Similar Articles: Group articles with similar headlines together.
Step 5: Provide Summaries- Summarization Algorithm: Use a summarization algorithm to generate summaries of articles. You can use libraries like Sumy or implement your own using NLP techniques.
    - Display Summaries: Provide an option for users to view summaries of grouped articles.
Step 6: Build the User Interface- Main Screen: Display a list of news articles with options to view by source or summary.
    - Detail Screen: Show the full article or summary when a user selects an article.
    - Settings Screen: Allow users to customize their news sources and preferences.
Step 7: Test Your App- Unit Testing: Write unit tests for your code to ensure it works as expected.
    - UI Testing: Test the user interface to make sure it is intuitive and responsive.
Step 8: Deploy Your App- Publish on Google Play: Follow the guidelines to publish your app on the Google Play Store.
    - Gather Feedback: Encourage users to provide feedback and use it to improve your app.
Example Code SnippetHere's a basic example of how you might set up a Retrofit call to fetch news articles:

```KOTLIN
public interface NewsApiService {
    @GET("v2/top-headlines")
    Call<NewsResponse> getTopHeadlines(@Query("apiKey") String apiKey, @Query("sources") String sources);
}

// In your Activity or ViewModel
Retrofit retrofit = new Retrofit.Builder()
    .baseUrl("https://newsapi.org/")
    .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
    .build();

NewsApiService service = retrofit.create(NewsApiService.class);
Call<NewsResponse> call = service.getTopHeadlines("YOUR_API_KEY", "bbc-news, cnn");
call.enqueue(new Callback<NewsResponse>() {
    @Override
    public void onResponse(Call<NewsResponse> call, Response<NewsResponse> response) {
        if (response.isSuccessful()) {
            List<Article> articles = response.body().getArticles();
            // Process articles
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure(Call<NewsResponse> call, Throwable t) {
        // Handle failure
    }
});
```

Feel free to ask if you need more detailed guidance on any specific part of the process. Good luck with your app development! ðŸš€
